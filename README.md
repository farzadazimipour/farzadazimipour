## Hi there 👋

I’m **Farzad**, an Android Software Engineer with **9+ years of experience** building high-performance, scalable mobile applications.

I specialize in **Kotlin** and modern Android development, with strong hands-on experience in **Jetpack Compose**, **Clean Architecture**, and **modularized codebases**. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with architectural patterns like **MVVM** and **MVI**, focusing on writing **testable, maintainable, and performant code**.

Currently, I’m working on large-scale production apps at **TUI**, where I contribute to:

* Migrating legacy UIs from XML to **Jetpack Compose**
* Transitioning async code from **RxJava to Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**
* Improving architecture by moving from **MVP to MVVM**
* Optimizing performance and enhancing user experience

I enjoy **refactoring legacy systems**, collaborating in **Agile/Scrum teams**, and **mentoring junior developers**. I’m passionate about staying up to date with Android best practices and leveraging new technologies to deliver clean, impactful solutions.

**Tech I work with often:**

* Kotlin, Java, Android SDK
* Jetpack Compose, Material Design
* Coroutines, Flow, RxJava
* Clean Architecture, MVVM, MVI
* Unit & UI Testing, CI/CD, Git
