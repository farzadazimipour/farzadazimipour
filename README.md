## Hi there 👋

I’m **Farzad**, an Android Software Engineer focused on building high-performance, scalable mobile applications.

I specialize in **Kotlin** and modern Android development, with strong hands-on experience in **Jetpack Compose**, **Clean Architecture**, and **modularized codebases**. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with architectural patterns like **MVVM** and **MVI**, focusing on writing **testable, maintainable, and performant code**.

**Tech I work with often:**

* Kotlin, Java, Android SDK
* Jetpack Compose, Android Views (XML), Jetpack Libraries
* Coroutines, Flow, RxJava
* Clean Architecture, MVVM, MVI, multi-module codebases
* Unit & UI Testing, CI/CD setup, Git workflows
* Gradle build system, build performance optimization
* Cross-platform development with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)
* AI/ML integration on Android (ML Kit, TensorFlow Lite, LLM-based APIs)
